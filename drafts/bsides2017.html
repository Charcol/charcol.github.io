<p>Equipped with a backpack, I headed to Brisbane airport for my first adventure to Canberra for the Bsides security conference. I was a bit disappointed to miss out on Bsides last year, so I made sure to get my ticket early for this one.</p>

<h2>About Bsides</h2>
<p>Security Bsides is a hacker conference in the US that was founded in 2009, but is now held all over the world by many different people.  Last year was the first Bsides in Australia, and this year it has doubled in size to 690 attendees, with around 250 on the wait list.  They've estimated that 15% of the attendees are female, based upon the number of ladies shirts ordered (all registrations come with a shirt).  The CFP acceptance rate was ~19%.</p>
<p>As well as the main presentation track, there was a hardware &amp; wireless presentation track and a separate area with workshops through both days.  Additionally, there were numerous competitions held over the conference, including a capture the flag (ctf), in which you complete challenges across various disciplines (reverse engineering, crypto, programming, forensics etc.), a table full of tamper evident seals and tags, lock picking tables and contest, an incident response challence, a bug bounty simulation, and a counter intelligence simulation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="day-0">
<h2>Day 0</h2>
<p>My first stop after checking in was to pre-register, where I recieved a pack with the conference badges, shirt, stickers, booklet, and lanyard.  One of the badges is a mifare nfc card.  The other is a</p>
<p>Afterwards, I went to a women's networking dinner.  There I spoke to several accomplished women and speakers, who also helped develop a presentation idea I've been sitting on for a while.  It's good to see this kind of event, as being in a minority can be isolating, and it's nice to meet some real role models in the security industry.</p>
<p>When that ended, I found other some other attendees having pre-conference drinks.  Even though I don't really drink, it's a great opportunity to meet people - and it paid off.  I met someone who uses OpenStack day to day, which was pretty exciting - this is the first time since starting I've gotten to really speak with someone who uses the product and the docs.  The conversation also got others around asking about OSP, so I was able to explain what it does and answer a few of their questions, which was exciting.</p>
<p>Back at the accommodation it was time to read the schedule and plan the next couple of days.  There's so much on, it's impossible to attend everything.  At my very first hacker con I made the mistake of getting caught up in the ctf and not seeing anything else.</p>
<p>Friday:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>9am Opening and Keynote (&quot;From 2600 to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave: Reflections on 15 years of infosec reporting&quot; by Patrick Gray)
I listen to his podcast, so I don't want to miss this.</p>
<p>10am &quot;Bug Bounty Simulation Contest Introduction&quot; - Shubs.  Looks fun, practical, definitly would learn something.  I've seen Shubs talk at Kiwicon.</p>
<p>2:30am &quot;Human vs Machine: A source code review challenge&quot;</p>
<p>Might go:</p>
<p>11:30am &quot;How to Program the Bsides Canberra 2017 badge&quot; - would be interesting, but not essential</p>
<p>2pm &quot;Shiny Toys vs Tools - getting better value out of your detection tool suite&quot;</p>
<p>The rest of the free time will be for ctf &amp; bug bounty simulation</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Saturday:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
9:10am  Infosec 101.1 - since I've mostly been self-taught with security things, I'd like to go just in case there are gaps in my foundational knowledge - and revision never hurts.
2:30pm  PANEL - this looks good because topics include Shadowbrokers[2], Did Russia hack the US election?, are hacker cons sexist?, state of Australasian hackers cons and census fail

Again, the rest of the free time will be for the ctf &amp; bug bounty simulation.  Also want to try escape from handcuffs at the lock picking table, and need passport stamped.
</pre>
<p>Lastly, I did the usual preparations before going to a hacker con.  Turn off WiFi on phone and laptop (and made sure no sensitive information was on either of those things).  Only going to access internet through usb-tethered phone, and only for research for the ctf.  Made sure all nfc/rfid cards are in shielded sleeves.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="day-1">
<h2>Day 1</h2>
<p>Keynote from Patrick Gray.
Bug Bountry intro
Spent a few hours exploring that
In the afternoon tried the ctf. Jeopardy style
Go to the two talks
Went to a talk that I had initally overlooked - flight data recovery (which ended up winning 'best new speaker' award)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="day-2">
<h2>Day 2</h2>
<p>Infosec 101 'workshop'.  Handy pdf guide.
Got passport stamped
Physical security talk
Lockpicking - handcuffs and someone disassembled a padlock and showed us different parts
Lunch
More bug bounty stuff
Panel
Closing
Afterparty - pentester 30% writing, fist bump</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-i-got-out-of-it">
<h2>What I got out of it</h2>
<p>Already knew report writing was important in this industry, but with the bug bounties, they were more likely to pay with a good report.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="concluding-thoughts">
<h2>Concluding thoughts</h2>
<p>Security is easily bypassed by users not knowing how to use a system properly.  Also defaults.  It is important to have accurate setup.  Putting defaults in makes people use those default passwords. Most exploits are misconfiguration rather than 1337 zero days.</p>
